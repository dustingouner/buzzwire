## Context
This project was assigned as a mock take home assignment in the fourth week of Module 4 at [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The application was built over the course of 8 hours. The goal was to stay within a time limit to test our knowledge on what we have learned over the last several weeks.
